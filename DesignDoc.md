## 2) Game Overview
* __Concept:__ 
Three or four group members make budget decisions for their local government based on the group's administration values, which are selected at the beginning of gameplay. Players must decide how to balance their budget each round, when certain scenarios arise where funds may need to be reallocated or cut. The point of the game is to simulate local government budgeting and illustrate the importance of appeasing their constituents throughout. Although there is no winner in Budgetopolis, each group is given a chance to reflect on their choices and see how much they were able to maintain their underlying values.

* __Target Audience:__ 
Currently it's comprised of School of Government students and elected officials, but in the future, should also include 
students (K-12).

* __Genres:__ Educational, Simulation, Board Game

* __Purpose:__ To educate players in the strategy and importance of balancing between budgeting and appeasing their constituents. The game will expose the players to real life scenarios that face elected officials currently in office including (for example), cuts to funding for certain groups. This game will help teach players how to work together effectively as a group, effeciently allocate funds, along with illustrating how certain actions can disrupt the populace.

* __Look and Feel:__ (will be revised) There will be a group (typically between 4-6 players) with a laptop that allows one player to input group budget decisions. The game will look similar to a board game, with an image of the game board showing the city or county's "resources", along with how much money is allocated for each. In the middle of the game board are the group's chosen values, each having the ability for the user to obtain more information about the topic. The players will also see in the top corner their funds available and on the side bar and across the bottom, different media outlets will blast stories, messages, etc regarding the actions the group took (intended to simulate real media and their tendencies). 

* __Intended Use:__ This game will be used in groups to begin training players about the basics of budgeting, along with how their actions can affect the populace they are "elected" to represent. It will also teach players how to work together effectively as a team, and become accustomed to certain group dynamics that are present in real life governmental roles.

## 3) Gameplay

* __Objectives:__ Properly represent the city/county by staying true to the group's chosen "values" along with maintaining a legal, sustainable budget. By working in groups, players will learn to work with another to create solutions to proposed scenarios that cause budget shifts, along with learning the effects of media when receiving blasts in real time (simulating TV, social media, newspapers, etc) in response to their actions.

* __Game Progression and Flow:__ (will be revised) The group will first be assigned a city/county which they must represent. The information included will notify the group of the district's location, population, size, etc which will dictate the amount of resources and funds available. Next, the group must choose four values from a list (with definitions given if a user clicks on one) that they want their administration to stand for along with allocating their budget to each of the resources on the board. Once initial game setup is complete, the computer will notify the group of a certain scenario where they must then adjust/re-allocate the funding to the various resources. Once the group inputs their decisions, the computer will generate media blasts that will "attack" their actions. This cycle repeats for each round, until a certain number of rounds (10?) is completed. Throughout the game, educational tid-bits are placed to teach players definitions, laws, rules, etc which are vital to understanding key concepts. 

* __Mission/Challenge Structure:__ The main challenge in this game is to efficiently and effectively maintain a balanced budget while staying true to the values selected. Any action taken that may contradict these values are subject to scrutiny in the media and general populace, which can lead to increased pressure facing the administration. Throughout the game, scenarios (simulating real life issues) are imposed on the group where they then must decide how to re-allocate their funds, all while appeasing their constituents.
