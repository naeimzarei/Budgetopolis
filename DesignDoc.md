## 2) Game Overview
* Concept: 
Three or four group members make budget decisions for their local government based on the group's city values, which are selected at the beginning of gameplay. Players must decide how to balance their budget each round, when certain scenarios arise where funds may need to be reallocated or cut. The point of the game is to simulate local government budgeting and illustrate the importance of appeasing their constituents throughout. Although there is no winner in Budgetopolis, each group is given a chance to reflect on their choices and see how much they were able to maintain their underlying values.

* Target Audience: 
Currently it's comprised of School of Government students and elected officials, but in the future, it should also include 
students (K-12).

* Genres: Educational, Simulation, Board Game

* Purpose: To educate students and elected officials alike in the strategy and importance of balancing between budgeting and appeasing their constituents. The game will expose the players to real life scenarios that face elected officials currently in office including (for example), cuts to funding for certain groups. This game will help teach players how to work together effectively as a group, effeciently allocate funds, along with illustrating how certain actions can disrupt the populace, all in real time. 

* Look and Feel: The game will look similar to a board game, with an image of the game board showing the city or county's "resources", along with how much money is allocated for each. In the middle of the game board are the group's chosen values, each of which will have the ability for the user to obtain more information about the topic. The players will also see in the top corner their funds available, and on the side bar and across the bottom, different media outlets will blast stories, messages, etc regarding the actions the group took. 

* Intended Use: This game will be used in groups to begin training players with the basics of budgeting, along with how their actions can affect the populace they are "elected" to represent. It will also teach players how to work together effectively as a team, and become accustomed to certain group dynamics that are present in real life governmental roles.
