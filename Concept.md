# Concept

Three or four group members make budget decisions for their local government
based on the group's city values, which are selected at the beginning of gameplay. 
Players must decide how to balance their budget each round, when certain scenarios
arise where funds may need to be reallocated or cut. The point of the game is to 
simulate local government budgeting and illustrate the importance of appeasing their
constituents throughout. Although there is no winner in Budgetopolis, each group is 
given a chance to reflect on their choices and see how much they were able to maintain 
their underlying values.
