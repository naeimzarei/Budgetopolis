# Concept

Three or four group members make budget decisions for their local government
based on the group's city values, which are selected at the beginning of gameplay. 
Players must decide how to balance their budget by cutting programs or raising fees. 
The point of the game is to simulate local government budgeting. Although there is no 
winner in Budgetopolis, each group is given a chance to reflect on their choices and 
see how much they were able to maintain their city values.
