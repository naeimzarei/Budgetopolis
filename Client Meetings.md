* Instructions: there should be some process explaining budgeting in general to those
playing Budgetopolis, prior or during the actual gameplay of Budgetopolis. Should 
explain why they can make a particular choice or why they cannot make a choice. Don't
assume the players will already know how to budget well. Explain it to them. 
* Think about changing the name of the game as well. 
* Individual groups are running their own games and do not have to wait for the other 
groups. Facilitator must only have access to group scoring. The groups don't even need
the same sequence of events. Consider the audience of a live audience component, and 
feedback they usually would have gotten if they were all playing as multiple groups. 
Whatever decision they make, the computer will decide what type of media feedback they
get: newspaper, social media, opinion pieces (to consider multiple audience responses).
Scale issue: different community sizes (resources, finances). Have an option to set the
municipality at the beginning of the game. Size of county should be set at the beginning 
of the game. Assign the community to the people at the beginning of the game. However,
the people can still pick their values. But they must consider the community that they
are given. 
* Budgeting: set the budget at the beginning of the game, depending on the municipality
that is selected for the group. 
* Design concept: kids versus adults, chips, actual gameplay.

* Game for newly elected officials: don't have the resources to expand and increase
the audience and different groups. Make it more interactive and dynamic. 
* Originally mainly for elected officials, now it is more about community. Game is
currently being used for students in School of Government as well for instruction. 
* There is a difference between the games Bottom Line! and Budgetopolis.
* Facilitator: instead of having one facilitator, the game logic would take care of 
deciding the result of the game, based on the rules. 
    1. Required roles: chair, county council, etc. 
    2. Values: which values are being prioritized in the community? Explain these values
    to the users. Could be called different things, open to suggestions. Consider audience
    group. Six values are prioritized. Do the choices of the players reflect the community values? The game logic should point out potential conflicts of values versus choices.
    3. Powerpoint: budgeting 101, required funding, average cuts and how cuts are decided
* Game logic: both games are same but the categories (services) change between Bottom Line! and Budgetopolis. This is just some of the game information, not an all-inclusive list. Also,
this part of the game is the most difficult to keep track of, but once this part is done, the 
facilitator's role is simplified so much. 
    1. Media: the facilitator plays this role, opinions captured in Twitter, news
    2. Rounds: no set number of rounds, choose by asking 
    3. Winning: there is no clear winner or loser, just a chance to reflect on choices
    and their respective outcomes. 
* Database and scoring: log each action and decision made by the groups and store in database. Allow users to pull information about the game, that can be possibly downloaded as PDF or CSV. Can have a highscore database path as well. Don't worry about outputing the 
actions. Just store them for future use and reference. May not have interface right now, but
may think about having access to the information later.
* Our roles: must simplify the game as much as possible. Must code the game. Must log actions.
Must determine game logic. Emulate social media. 
* This is a group game. So one laptop per group. 
* There would still be some kind of facilitator for the game, but the facilitator does not need a ton of expertise of the game mechanics in order to run it. 
* Game instances: do not have to be updated about other user's choices and decisions on the front-end, only the team's. 
* Take a look at the video instruction on the game of Budgetopolis to get a sense of how it 
is being played out. There will be a document about how the game works. 
* Games should be running at the same time. The instructor would be able to log in. 
* Suggestions: facilitator would be able to push information to the database, so no worry
about syncing groups. Facilitator IDs and session ID. Store the session IDs on the database so
it is static and doesn't change each time. 
* Decisions: what will be used to produce the game logic, where will the game be hosted
* Other notes: do not need to worry about UNC logins, and may not have to worry about SSL. Also consider Wi-Fi availability: downloadable component that could link back to web platform if the game shuts down unexpectedly all of a sudden. Do not worry about graphics. Could change the values of the games as we go down the timeline. Values stored in database. Working with different groups but sotring what is displayed on the database as a facilitator. Facilitator could pick a profile to fit his or her jurisdiction. Maybe some places have other roles than other ones, so this makes sense. We cannot capture how many resources are in each community role? How does that impact the gameplay? This is where Twitter comes in. The actions of other groups would trigger what is updated on the prototype Twitter that the 
players would see as a group on their device. How to display the values and the options to
the users without having to pass out the documents? 
* Editorial page: newspaper article, it's own page or on the page itself?
