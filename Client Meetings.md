* Game for newly elected officials: don't have the resources to expand and increase
the audience and different groups. Make it more interactive and dynamic. 
* Originally mainly for elected officials, now it is more about community. Game is
currently being used for students in School of Government as well for instruction. 
* There is a difference between the games Bottom Line! and Budgetopolis.
* Facilitator: instead of having one facilitator, the game logic would take care of 
deciding the result of the game, based on the rules. 
    1. Required roles: chair, county council, etc. 
    2. Values: which values are being prioritized in the community? Explain these values
    to the users. Could be called different things, open to suggestions. Consider audience
    group. Six values are prioritized. Do the choices of the players reflect the community values? The game logic should point out potential conflicts of values versus choices.
    3. Powerpoint: budgeting 101, required funding, average cuts and how cuts are decided
* Game mechanics: both games are same but the categories (services) change between Bottom Line! and Budgetopolis. This is just some of the game information. 
    1. Media: the facilitator plays this role, opinions captured in Twitter, news
    2. Rounds: no set number of rounds, choose by asking 
    3. Winning: there is no clear winner or loser, just a chance to reflect on choices
    and their respective outcomes. 
* Database and scoring: log each action and decision made by the groups and store in database. Allow users to pull information about the game, that can be possibly downloaded as PDF or CSV. Can have a highscore database path as well. Don't worry about outputing the 
actions. Just store them for future use and reference. May not have interface right now, but
may think about having access to the information later.
* Our roles: must simplify the game as much as possible. Must code the game. Must log actions.
Must determine game logic. Emulate social media. 
* This is a group game. So one laptop per group. 
* There would still be some kind of facilitator for the game, but the facilitator does not need a ton of expertise of the game mechanics in order to run it. 
* Game instances: do not have to be updated about other user's choices and decisions on the front-end, only the team's. 
* Take a look at the video instruction on the game of Budgetopolis to get a sense of how it 
is being played out. There will be a document about how the game works. 
* Games should be running at the same time. The instructor would be able to log in. 
* Suggestions: facilitator would be able to push information to the database, so no worry
about syncing groups. Facilitator IDs and session ID. Store the session IDs on the database so
it is static and doesn't change each time. 
* Decisions: what will be used to produce the game logic, where will the game be hosted
* Other notes: do not need to worry about UNC logins, and may not have to worry about SSL. Also consider Wi-Fi availability: downloadable component that could link back to web platform if the game shuts down unexpectedly all of a sudden. Do not worry about graphics.
